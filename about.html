                      <p style="text-align: justify;"> Hi, It gives me great pleasure to say with pride that I have completed my undergraduate degree in B.SC.Nursing from Jennys College of Nursing (JCON). The relationship between the students and the faculties is cordial, which gives an opportunity to excel in our area of interest. The four years spent here were splendid and has helped me to grow better professionally and personally. Each year we got moulded into what we are today. I’ve felt at home at JCON from the start and I’m happy I made the decision to come.
                      </p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"> I have witnessed our skill and competence rising to a zenith. The learner centered environment crafted here, not only trained us in the academic curriculum but also motivated us. The curriculum is up to date. The faculties are determined, experienced and helpful. We had an good infrastructure, library and Labs which are well equipped for each specialities. Various workshops, clubs and fests were happening which brings our inner talent.
                        </p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the working field, students who have passed out of JCON shines apart from others. Currently I am working in MIOT Hospitals in chennai, initially I was very afraid of the working environment, but it was really easier than I imagined, which I need to thank our college again for their guidance and encouragement. What we learn here will really be helpful in our work. Now I have been promoted as Incharge in only 3 years, which proves the worth of our institution. I owe a lot to JCON, which is my second home, which will take a special place in my heart and life. Actually I’m a shy person, but my fears have been shattered here. I would like to thank Jennys College Of Nursing, our Principal Mam, all the faculties and staff for making me a “ BETTER PERSON”.

                      <p style="text-align: justify;">I was the first batch (genesis) student of JCON in the year of 2011 - 2015. I am currently working as staff nurse at MOH Saudi Arabia. I am forever thankful to our management, Principal Mrs. Mary Rita mam, all my teachers, my friends, and other faculty members. Teachers were caring like mother and became a mentor and guide in facilitating learning experiences. When I was in JCON learned many things, enjoyed every experience. I love the atmosphere of the college which is a natural reserve of learning, peace, joy and moral growth. The faculty members were truly caring both in curricular and extracurricular activities.
                      </p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"> As a Tamil medium student I was unable to cope up with the classes initially. Learning the student difficulty our principal mam arranged special classes for English which helped us to improve academically. I thank Mrs. Mary Rita mam and all my teachers who had helped me to pass out successfully. Special thanks to the principal mam who is a wonderful  women, good supporter and counsellor. She is a role model for us. 
                        </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Jennys CON had moulded us in all dimentions. Initially I got the opportunity to work in Narayana medical college and hospital, Andhra Pradesh which was through campus interview. I was able to practice all that I had learnt in a full pledged manner. Now Almighty God had helped me to work abroad. I am placed secure and earning a good deal successfully. I Thank you for giving me this opportunity to think back and share my experience. Once again I would like to thank JCON and almighty God for uplifting my career.

                      <p style="text-align: justify;"> I am Rajeshwari Manoharan. I am one of the passed-out students at Jenny's college of nursing (2016).
                      </p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"> After I did my nursing degree I joined as a staff nurse at Miot International hospital, Chennai. I had 2 years’ experience in the unit of nephrology including pre and post renal transplant (2017 Jan to 2019 feb). After that I resigned from my job and got married. I just had a 3-month break and then joined as a transplant nurse at Apollo hospital Trichy. After that I started applying for higher studies abroad. I got admission at the University of Bedfordshire, Luton, England, United Kingdom. It is my dream destination. I started studying for a Master of Science in Public Health (M.Sc. Public Health) during (2019 Sep to 2021 Sep) now I finished my master and working as a NURSING ASSOCIATE in UK GOV (LUTON AND DUNSTABLE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL NHS TRUST). I finished my OET exam and got B grade in all 4 modules and waiting for my UK nursing council registration. I feel so proud that I am one of the JENNYS PRODUCT.
                        </p><p style="text-align: justify;">When I started the nursing course it was very difficult for me because I am a proper Tamil medium student and belong to an interior village called Thalikkottai. When I started my first year our beloved Principal mam and all my tutors and lectuers were so supportive and kind to teach the lessons. They are very patient when explaining each and every word. I worked hard and met all my exams. In this institute they took us to various speciality hospitals for the practical exposure. I went to different hospitals according to my specialty. Once I crossed my first year I felt nursing is a wonderful course it's only because of my teachers and my management. We went to different hospital postings and field trips and especially community postings for community health nursing. I enjoyed it throughout my 4 years. Not only in education every year they conduct sports and cultural meet which was so enjoyable and entertaining. They encourage academic toppers with prizes and awards. we celebrate all the functions and festivals like Diwali, Pongal, Christmas, children’s day, teachers’ day, etc,
                        </p><p style="text-align: justify;">I extend my gratitude towards my management, because they are so supportive during my 4year study. They took us to picnics as well as we went on an educational tour to NEW DELHI and KULLUMANALI during my final year. Special mention for hostel facilities, food and college bus facilities. Which was excellent..

                        </p><p style="text-align: justify;">JENNYS is best for everything like demo, labs library where there are so many books with internet facilities. They take special care of our Health, Safety and inculcate spirituality, discipline and moral values in us, which moulded us into a good Human being. Because of Jenny's only now I am here. I would like to thank my principal mam, all my teachers, management, hostel warden mam, all the akkas who working as housekeeper and my seniors and juniors at last my very own SPARKLES (my friend’s classmates) and my parents, and god’s grace.

                      <p style="text-align: justify;"> "Nurse: Just another word to describe a person strong enough to tolerate everything and soft enough to understand everyone". This is my great inspirational start to get in to the field of Nursing. 
                      </p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"> I am Pavithra, Currently working as a registered nurse (liver transplant ICU) at Rela Institute and Medical Center. I completed my nursing education from Jennys College of Nursing in 2019.  When I first joined as student, I had a lot of confusion, fear, and nervousness. But soon I saw how friendly everybody were and how helpful and patient the instructors and staff were to me which eased by initial stress. 
                        </p><p style="text-align: justify;">The college has good infrastructure, classrooms and protective hostel with healthy nutrition which made me feel at home. I am grateful to our honorable correspondent sir for such a wonderful provision of comprehensive learning. We had good clinical exposure in government & private hospitals. Before our clinical posting we were equipped by simulation training in our well equipped fundamental laboratory.
                        </p><p style="text-align: justify;">The relationship between faculties and students was cordial, which gave me more opportunity and interest in studies and excel. Best part of our institution is the experienced and dedicated faculties. They not only educate us, but also build the confidence within us. They had shown me that I can handle lot more than I thought I could. It's really hard to single out one because each of them has taught me something or other to brighten up my career. Every clinical rotation and assignment brought a new challenge & imbibed experience and skill, which helped me further into the pathway to success.
                        </p><p style="text-align: justify;">My heartfelt thanks to our respected principal madam, who had supported and guided to us to become who we, are today. She was not only bold but also kind, and an excellent role model for us. I am thankful to my friends and colleagues in Jennys who gave me emotional and mental support. 
                        </p><p style="text-align: justify;">I happily suggest JCON to my dears and known people if they had a dream to pursue nursing as their carrier. I feel extremely happy to be a part of this big Jennys family. I sincerely thank God for giving me this wonderful opportunity. All credits goes to God and my mother Institution “JENNYS” and your dedication.
